This is a little app to help make cover pages. Just edit the json file with a regexp friendly id that acts as a keyword search, a skill level to put your best for forward, and a sentence to add if the job description matches. Note: there is a opening and closing that should also be changed. 

Then just paste in the job description and a cover letter will be created. The non-cover letter elements are hidden, so you can just print at that point. I prefer to print as pdf. To continue editing, or retry, just click on the letter to return to the previous view. The font can be chosen, but not all will be necessarily be available. The top fonts should be web safe.

RE: pdf hyperlinks using Microsoft Windows. I have only been able to print to pdf while retaining links in Firefox/Pale Moon and the Edge browser. On the Edge browser didn't have page meta information in the corners.
